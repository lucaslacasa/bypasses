Here we append three Matlab functions, necessary to compute several quantities associated to network bypasses, resistive paths and communicability. Clarifications of each of the appended functions are depicted within each individual file. Further clarifications, if needed, can be requested to Prof. Estrada (estrada@ifisc.uib-csic.es).

Real data used in the paper above is in the public domain; references to these datasets are provided in the paper and its supplementary information.
